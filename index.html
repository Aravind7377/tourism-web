        <div class="desc">One of the prime attractions of all the nine waterfalls, Main Falls also known as Peraruvi is situated in the town center. It falls from an altitude of 60m and serves as the biggest of all the falls in the area. In fact, the water stream besides being a major sightseeing spot, is also place of worship for locals.</div>

        <div class="desc">The water here splits into five branches while falling, so it is called Five Falls. It is unique as water flows in five directions, resembling a 5-headed cobra. It is highly revered among locals as they compare it to Adishesha. Among the five falls, three are open to men and two for women.</div>

        <div class="desc">In addition to keeping the name of the nearby town Courtallam (or Kutralam), Iâ€™ve also seen this waterfall referred to by the more straightforward name of Old Falls.

            Julie and I noticed that Old Courtallam Falls consisted of a somewhat <br>naturally stairstepping upper tier before continuing on in a lower man-modified tier.
            
            The man-modified characteristic of the lower tiers appeared to be brought about <br> because they artificially dammed the plunge pool between the upper and lower falls so there were shallow pools that were more like swimming or bathing pools.</div>

        <div class="desc">The Shenbagadevi Falls is a waterfall which flows through shenbaga trees that gives the Falls its name. The waterfall flows from a height of 40 ft and is located on the road that leads to Honey Falls. The spot can be reached through a trek route from the Main Falls.</div>
